### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Josh and I'm a first year BSc Computer Science undergradurate student at University of Warwick! Occasionally I code in my free time, but to be honest I do so much of it for my degree I might as well just class that as my free time!

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java & C

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various coursework bits

ğŸ’¬ AI'm probably going to start blogging here: https://joshdavies14.github.io/

ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
