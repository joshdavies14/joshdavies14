### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh and I'm a first year BSc Computer Science undergradurate student at University of Warwick! Occasionally I code in my free time, but to be honest I do so much of it for my degree I might as well just class that as my free time!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java & Haskell (and revising for exams!)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on redesigning our [Computing Society website](https://github.com/joshdavies14/uwcs-dextre)

ðŸ’¬ You can learn more about me [here](https://poly.work/josh) and check out my blog [here](https://joshdavies.tech/)

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/they
